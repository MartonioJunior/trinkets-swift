# Trinkets

Trinkets is a framework that provides a base for implementing gameplay features (Resources, Inventory, Progression, etc.) through a common set of useful abstractions:

- (Soon) Swift implementation of Foundation's Units and Measurements focused on Composition and Generics.
- (Soon) Item and Inventory system with nesting capabilities (inventories inside of inventories) and based on Set Theory.
- (Soon) Exchange system for implementing game economies.
